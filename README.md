# javascript_2

<p>This is a simple Javascript page that was done where the list items can be shown where the headline is.</P>

<p><strong>Possible valuable uses:</p></strong>
<ul>
  <li>Online testing site</li>
  <li>Online questionnaire/survery</li>
  <li>Can be used with an interactive slideshow to replace photos where the headline would be, perhaps. Can give the user the opportunity to control the pace of the slide.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Please note that I had some trouble with the button portion, in an attempt to allow the user to add new items. Adding new items
  would be useful for say, a survery or test where a user can put in answers for an "other" label.
